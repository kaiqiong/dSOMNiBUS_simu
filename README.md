# dSOMNiBUS_simu
Codes to replicate the simulation results in the article "Addressing dispersion in mis-measured multivariate binomial outcomes: a novel statistical approach for detecting differentially methylated regions in bisulfite sequencing data".

* Scenario 1:
   3 covaraites with smooth effect curves as shown in Figure 4(A)
* Scenario 2:
  1 covariate. 14 different settings corresponding to varying methylation differences between two groups --- settings used for generating the power plot
* Scenario 3:
  2 covaraites - one with a quadratic shape, one is the negative control with 0 effect
